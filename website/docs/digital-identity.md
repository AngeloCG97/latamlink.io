Public key cryptography has been in use for several decades and has evolved to a set of standards for digital signatures. Many governments have adopted digital signature standards so individuals or businesses can obtain identity certificates and use them to sign legal documents.

> LatamLink aspires to integrate self-sovereign identity for end users that is compatible with national digital identities and digital signatures commonly used by large enterprise users.

Integrating digital identity to blockchain networks opens new opportunities, for example: 

- Integrating digital identity with blockchain will reduce the need for KYC.

- Seamlessly integrating with existing IT solutions.

- Removing the complex private key mechanics from the user experience.


## X.509 client certificates 

Certificates issued by a Certificate Authority (CA) who is responsible for validating the user's identity is commonly used for Digital Indentity. These certificates can then be used to generate blockchain private keys.
