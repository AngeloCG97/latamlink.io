The monitoring of what is happening in the network is essential to improve it and measure the social impact of its solutions.

The main objective is to produce decentralized and trusty information about each node and the activity of the network.

## On-Chain monitoring

- Smart Contract for monitoring EOSIO.
- Investigate the monitoring capacity another blockchain networks, e. g. Ethereum.

### Monitoring Contracts examples:

- [EOS Mechanics](https://github.com/AlohaEOS/eos-mechanics)
- [EOS Block Producer Benchmarks](https://www.alohaeos.com/tools/benchmarks) por [Aloha EOS](https://www.alohaeos.com/)
- [Block Producer Performance](https://labs.eostitan.com/#/block-producer-performance) por [EOS Titan](https://eostitan.com/)

## Off-Chain monitoring

- A distributed oracle that provides performance data to a smart contract
- The data could come from validators (all have the same weight)
- The permissioner committee reserves the discretional right to delete a block producer.

### Information about nodes
- To what entity belongs
- Nodes location
- Performant metrics and node availability
- Public data


### Cloud monitoring

Besides to take advantage of the services in the existent clouds for monitoring.

 - Prometheus
 - Grafana

Additionally, we will explore Blockchain Analytics tools and Data Science.


## Network Monitoring

We propose to create a native [network monitor](monitor.md) to achieve this objective.
