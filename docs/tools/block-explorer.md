A block explorer is a tool for visualizing all transactions that occur on the network. 

## EOSIO Explorer
[ESOIO Explorer](https://github.com/EOSIO/eosio-explorer) is a complete web application for communicating with an EOSIO blockchain developed as an open source project by Block One.

The aim of this application is to provide application developers for LACChain EOSIO (consisting of smart contract developers and front-end developers) a quick and easy way to visualize and test such applications on the EOSIO blockchain.

LACChain EOSIO has plans to install  **eosq**, a block explorer that provides access to detailed, accurate, actionable data about accounts, actions, validator nodes, and more on the LACChain EOSIO testnet.

eosq was developed by [dfuse](https://www.dfuse.io/) for the EOSIO community.
