We are still working on this aspect of the network. Please refer to the [Project Roadmap](./roadmap.md).

LACChain is designed to be technology-agnostic. We aim to integrate several blockchain protocols used in LACChain.

The interoperability between distinct blockchain protocols could be achieved in two ways:

 **Trusted Peers:** This modality is simpler to implement. It uses a trust layer to determine what occurs on each chain.

 **Trustless:** It is a more challenging solution, specially between different consensus protocols such as POW -> DPOS.

## Ethereum Interoperability -> EOSIO

## Ethereum Interoperability <-> EOSIO

## EVM on EOSIO

Block.one announced a smart contract challenge, offering a prize of 200,000 dollars to the winner:

"In this challenge, the participants should create an EOSIO Smart Contract that can store and invoke EVM (Solidity) Smart Contracts in a virtual environment similar to the Ethereum one", is detailed in one announcement of February 3rd in EOSIO DevPost.
