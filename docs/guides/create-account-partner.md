The partners in the LAAChain EOSIO network are entities that are part of the permitting committee, which are in charge of regulating and managing the management of resources and access to the network.

Each partner has the autonomy to manage in a personalized way the resources available to its affiliates in the network, these have within their functions::

- Create accounts on the network.
- Manage resources.
- Be part of the permitting committee.

The partners can deploy different types of nodes in the network, in the following table you can see them

| Node type | Partner | Non-Partner |
|-----------|:-------:|:-----------:|
| **Validation nodes**| ![Yes](/img/yes-icon.svg) |  ![No](/img/no-icon.svg)  |
| **Boot nodes**     | ![Yes](/img/yes-icon.svg) |  ![No](/img/no-icon.svg)  |
