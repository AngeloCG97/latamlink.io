:::note Work in Progress
We are still working on this aspect of the network. Please refer to the [Project Roadmap](.testent/roadmap).
:::

The `Non-Partners` are a type of entity within the LAAChain EOSIO network with some peculiar characteristics with the nodes that they can deploy that differentiate it from the `Partners`:

| Node Type | Partner | Non-Partner |
|-----------|:-------:|:-----------:|
| **Validator nodes** | ![Yes](/img/yes-icon.svg) |  ![No](/img/no-icon.svg)  |
| **Boot nodes**      | ![Yes](/img/yes-icon.svg) |  ![No](/img/no-icon.svg)  |
| **Writer nodes**    | ![Yes](/img/yes-icon.svg) | ![Yes](/img/yes-icon.svg) |
| **Observer nodes**  | ![Yes](/img/yes-icon.svg) | ![Yes](/img/yes-icon.svg) |

You can consult more information about [authorizations and traceability](../testnet/traceability)
