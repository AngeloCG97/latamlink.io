## Create account using an application

In the LACChain EOSIO network, end user accounts can be created through applications deployed on the network or through a partner.

Here is a list of projects in which they make use of account accounts in LACChain EOSIO:

- [LifeBank](https://lifebank.io/)
- [Inmutrust](https://inmutrust.com/)
- [SMARTGATE](https://smartgate.tech/)
- [Notario Digital](https://notarize.eosio.cr/dashboard/notary)
- [EOS Mechanics](https://dashboard.latamlink.io/node-performance)

## Create an account by a partner

### 1. Generate private keys

Keys are a requirement to create an account on a blockchain. See the following tutorial to create [private keys](./private-keys).

###  2. Request an account from a Partner

In order to create an account in LACChain EOSIO, it is necessary to establish communication with a `partner`, who are in charge of creating the accounts.

To see the list of partners that are part of the network go [here] (./partners).

The account name must meet certain requirements: characters from A to Z in lowercase, numbers from 1 to 5 and be 12 characters long. For the example, we will call the account: `hellocontract`.
