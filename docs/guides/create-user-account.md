There are several ways to obtain an account in LACChain EOSIO, the most common are through an application or through a registered entity.

## Create account using an application

In the LACChain EOSIO network, end user accounts can be created through applications deployed on the network or through a partner or non-partner.

Here is a list of projects which register accounts on LACChain EOSIO for it's users:

- [LifeBank](https://lifebank.io/)
- [Inmutrust](https://inmutrust.com/)

## Create an account though a registered entity

### 1. Generate a key pair

Keys are a requirement to create an account on a blockchain. See the following tutorial to create [private keys](./private-keys). Once you create your key pair, public and private keys, **you must only share the public key** when requesting a new account on LACChain EOSIO.

###  2. Request an account from a Partner

In order to create an account in LACChain EOSIO, it is necessary to establish communication with a `partner`, who are in charge of creating the accounts.

To see the list of partners that are part of the network go [here](./partners).

> **New account names must meet the following criteria:**
 - Not be previously registered
 - Be composed of characters from A to Z in lowercase, numbers from 1 to 5 
 - For the example we may call an account: `hellocontract`.
